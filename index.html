        <h3>Why lunch?</h3>
        <p>Lunch may even more importance for school-aged children than it does for adults. Since most kids don’t get breakfast or dinner at school and may not have any snacks until they get home, lunch is the only meal they have to power them
          through the day. According to <span>ChoiceUSA.net</span>, school lunch makes up one third to one half of a child’s nutritional intake for an entire day and is essential for helping children succeed in school as well as grow and develop successfully and
          healthfully.</p>

        <h3>What about school provided lunch?</h3>
        <p>A 2009 investigation by USA Today found that meat served in U.S. schools wouldn’t meet the quality or safety standards of fast-food restaurants. And according to the book Lunch Lessons, almost half the vegetables eaten by most children
          aged 2 to 19 in the U.S. were French fries.</p>

        <p> Although America’s school lunches have improved since Congress strengthened the standards for the national school lunch program in 2010, they have a long way to go.</p>

        <p> Most menus now include more whole grains and more fruit and vegetable options and less salt. But they also offer an abundance of factory-farmed animal products and heavily processed foods, like corn dogs, tater tots, and cheese pizza.</p>
